Questions for Chris on SMS2WS_SyncAgent
=======================================
1. WebMethods class and all its methods as abstract OK?

2. How should I implement Error Handling?

3. How should I handle the DateTime property if I want it to be able to output null or empty string in the Xml?

4. Factory classes as internal static?
=> OK, but rename to Repository

5. Error messages: Methods that return an object can also return an error string. Should this be handled via an output parameter or via Exception Handling? Example: GetProductById()
==> Use Excepton Handling

6. Breakdown of class WebMethods with nested classes in order to get WebMethods.ProductMethods, WebMethods.CustomerMethods etc. Is this approach OK or is there a better way? Should I use partial classes?
=> Use wrapper class with methods that return a reference to the specific classes

7. How do I get started with GitHub?


TEST Questions
--------------
1. Recommendations for naming convention of tests.
=> OK

2. How should I handle test data? For instance UpdateCustomer creates a new customer, but DeleteCustomer only sets a deleted timestamp. 
   Result: after many tests I end up with lots of unneeded customers marked as deleted.
   Q: should the DB have special provision for test objects?
   Q: should the DB contain special test objects guaranteed to exist for testing purposes?
=> Get Fluency library from newGit
   
3. Is it OK to have several Assert statements in a single test?
=> Yes

4. Test UpdateProductCategory_creates_new_category_and_returns_ok() fails with nCrunch on a line that is not actually failing when run. How come?
=> Fixed, had to specify "Copy always" for the picture file properties.


Use Auto properties
Consider NewtonSoft.Json instead of XML
Content Type of API return should be "xml"
Evaluate REST for http interaction
Check out AutoMapper to copy one object to another
Check out https://github.com/ChrisEdwards/Shiloh.Testing for object camparison

=> Roll my own ARandom as a static class, implementing all functions of the existing ARandom and simply returning ARandom.Func
=> Extend ARandom with methods to generate produdtIDs, EANs, ISBNs, ISMNs, UPCs, etc.
